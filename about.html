<h1>Pyour web - simplicity matters</h1>
<h2>Bloated web</h2>
<p>People have to process and filter immense quantities of data for <b>essential information</b> daily. The good news, most of the information is available in the world wide web. The bad news, the information is buried under a heap of useless data. The web is bloated. Websites are full of distracting advertising, animations, style sheets and javascript code making it hard and exhausting to find information. </p>

<p>The web should be available for everyone and serve all of humanity.</p>
<h2>How pyour web can help people ?</h2>
<p>pyour web (pyour pronounced as in pure (/pj~Jr/))) brings the web back to the people by decluttering the websites and reducing it to the essentials, to words.

<h2>How can you help spreading the pure word ?</h2>
